[Final Project]

INSTRUCTION:
To play the game, the user on needs to use the keys ASDW and a mouse cursor to move the scene view and collect objects. 

There are multiples interactive objects that can be collected and used.

The player's goal is to connect the objects, solve the puzzles, and make way out of the room.

NOTE:
Because of some technical problems, we cannot extract the built app. We will show it in the demo. Thank you!!!
